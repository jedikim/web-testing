"""Executor Pool — reuses a single browser across multiple sessions.

Avoids the overhead of launching a new Chromium browser for each task.
The pool owns the browser; individual executors own only their context+page.

Usage::

    pool = await ExecutorPool.create(headless=True)
    executor = await pool.acquire()
    # ... use executor ...
    await pool.release(executor)
    await pool.close()
