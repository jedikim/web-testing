"""Selector Recovery Pipeline — automatic selector repair on SelectorNotFound failures.

When a step fails because a selector no longer matches the DOM, this pipeline:

1. Runs the step via ``run_fn``.
2. If it passes on the first attempt, returns immediately.
3. On ``SelectorNotFound`` failure:
   a. Optionally calls ``build_candidates_fn`` to gather DOM candidates.
   b. Optionally calls ``suggest_patch_fn`` to propose a new selector (counts as
      an LLM call).
   c. Retries ``run_fn`` with the patched context.
4. Repeats up to ``max_attempts`` total attempts.

Design principles:
  - All callables are injected — no hard dependency on LLM or DOM modules.
  - Pure async function, no mutable state.
  - Frozen dataclasses for all inputs/outputs.

See docs/ARCHITECTURE.md for the escalation flow context.
